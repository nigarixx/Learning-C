# Learning-C
Learning to code in C programming language. (My personal journey in studying C programming)

1.c - Displaying the first 10 natural numbers.

2.c - Sum of first 10 natural numbers.

3.c - Finding cube of the number upto a given integer.

4.c- Sum of 2 integers.

5.c - Accepts three integers and find the maximum of three.

6.c - Displaying the pattern like right angle triangle with a number.

7.c - Displaying a pattern like right angle triangle with a number which will repeat a number in a row.

8.c - Displaying a pattern like right angle triangle with number increased by 1.

9.c - Sum of the series 1 +11 + 111 + 1111 + .. n terms.

10.c - Displaying the pattern like a diamond.

11.c - Displaying the pattern like a pyramid.

12.c - Displaying the pattern in which the first and a last number of each row will be 1

13.c - Accept the height of a person in centimeter and categorize the person according to their height.

14.c - Accept a coordinate point in a XY coordinate system and determine in which quadrant the coordinate point lies.

15.c - Sum of the three given integers. However, if any of the values is in the range 10..20 
inclusive then that value counts as 0, except 13 and 17.

16.c - Storing elements in an array.

17.c - n number of values in an array and displaying it in reverse order.
